# TestClass-grading-scripts
This is the directory for your new grading scripts. By default this directory should include a couple simple tests for a fake Hwk_00 assignment.  It is recommended that you have your students treat this as an real assignment to get everyone adjusted to the grading script setup.

You can use the Hwk_00_Tests.py and Batch_Hwk_00.py files as templates for future grading assignments.  The core-scripts directory contains additional tests and tools for creating tests.
